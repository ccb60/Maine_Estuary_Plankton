#Introduction
This notebook generates CSV files to import into ArcGIS , and a simple crosswalk
table to facilitate consistent matching of zooplankton data and phytoplankton
data. The two organizations collecting data used somewhat different site and
sample naming conventions. This is my effort to standardize conversion.

# Load Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

# Load Zooplankton Data
We load this data first because our goal is to translate from the Zooplankton
data sample coding to the phytoplankton data coding scheme, as the phytoplankton 
data has a clear and consistent sample coding scheme.  

Also, the one clue I have to the "translation" is in the first two columns of 
the "Phyto_Environment" tab in the Zooplankton data

But the match is not 100%, so we need to figure out how to handle the 
non-matches.

```{r}
zoopl_sample_codes <- read_excel("Seanet ALL DATA FILE.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Phyto_Enviromental", range = "a1:h53") %>%
  select(-c(year, month, `time h`)) %>%
  mutate(mock_id = paste0('SNT_',date, '_', bigelow_id )) %>%
  relocate(mock_id)
```

## All Locations
I use the `first()` function here because I notice some inconsistencies in the 
latitude and longitude reported from some sites.  It looks like latitude and 
longitude were copied incorrectly at least once. Specifically, RAM and Wood
appear to have been mislabeled at least once.

Note that I add `estuary' and `estuary_order` values here to facilitate later 
models.  

```{r}
all_sites <- zoopl_sample_codes %>%
  select(-date, -mock_id) %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  summarize(bigelow_id = first(bigelow_id),
            latitude = first(`latitude decdeg`),
            longitude = -first(`longitude decdeg`),
            is_phyto = ! is.na(bigelow_id)) %>%
  mutate(estuary = case_when(grepl('BRE', ID) ~ 'Bagaduce',
                             grepl('DRE', ID) ~ 'Damariscotta',
                             grepl('NME', ID) ~ 'New Meadows',
                             TRUE         ~ 'Saco'),
         estuary_order = case_when(estuary != 'Saco' ~ as.numeric(substr(ID, nchar(ID), nchar(ID))),
                                   ID == '3/4 BUOY' ~ 3,
                                   ID == 'Wood' ~ 2,
                                   ID == 'RAM' ~ 1)) %>%
  relocate(estuary, estuary_order, .after = 'bigelow_id') 
all_sites
```

We need the `na = ''` code to facilitate reading this file into ArcGIS. 
Otherwise, the code outputs "NA" for missing values, which ArcGIS reads as 
a character value.

```{r}
write.csv(all_sites, "all_sites.csv", na = '')
```

## Matching PhytoPlankton Locations
I base latitude and longitude on the first reported locations, as RAM and Wood
appear to have been mislabeled at least once.

```{r}
site_crosswalk <- zoopl_sample_codes %>%
  select(-date, -mock_id) %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  summarize(bigelow_id = first(bigelow_id),
            latitude = first(`latitude decdeg`),
            longitude = -first(`longitude decdeg`)) %>%
  filter(! is.na(bigelow_id))
site_crosswalk
```

```{r}
write.csv(site_crosswalk, "site_crosswalk.csv")
```
