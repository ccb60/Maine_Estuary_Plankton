Analysis of data on zooplankton, phytoplankton, and limited environmental 
variables from southern Maine


#Introduction
This repository contains data and code  looking at several data sets on plankton,
in support of a masters degree projeCt at the University of Southern Maine. The
purpose is to examine data analysis strategies for these data.

As this is all preliminary data, shared with me only for developign anlysis 
ideas, I am uncertain of ots QA/QC status.
