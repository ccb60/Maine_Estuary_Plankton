#Introduction
In this notebook, I am taking a first stab at zooplankton community analysis.
We look principally at Non-metric multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis.
We rely on the `vegan` package for most of the underlying tools. 

# Load Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

library(vegan)

theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

# Load Data
```{r}
zoopl_data_long <- read_excel("Seanet ALL DATA FILE.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Zoop_Composition") %>%
  arrange(Estuary, STATION, DATE)
```

### Community Data Matrix
```{r}
zoopl_community <- zoopl_data_long %>%
  mutate(new_id = paste(Estuary, STATION, DATE, sep = '_')) %>%
  rename(count = `QUANTITY`,
         name = NAME) %>%
  select(new_id, name, count)
```

We saw one double entered value: for Balanus on

Bagaduce_2_2017-07-19

With that in the data set, it has trouble making a community matrix. We correct
by adding the two Balanus entries together.  That needs to be confirmed.

# Two rows of Balanus from one sample.
```{r}
zoopl_community$count[18] <- 35 + 29
zoopl_community <- zoopl_community[-19,]
```

```{r}
  zoopl_community <- zoopl_community%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = name, values_from = count, values_fill = 0)
```

### Reorder columns by mean count
```{r}
my_order <- zoopl_community %>%
  summarize(across(c(-1), mean)) %>%
  unlist %>%
  sort(decreasing = TRUE) %>%
  names
my_order
```

```{r}
zoopl_community <- zoopl_community %>%
  select(new_id, all_of(my_order))
zoopl_community
```


## Default 2-D NMDS
```{r}
NMDS_default <- metaMDS(zoopl_community[,-1], k = 2, autotransform = TRUE,
                        maxit = 50, trymax = 50)
```


```{r}
zoopl_trim <- zoopl_community %>%
  column_to_rownames(var = "new_id") %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(rare = sum(c(Membranipora, Oikopleura, Tortanus, Obelia, 
                      Podonidae, Bivalve, Crangon, Bougainvillia))) %>%
  select(-c(Membranipora :  Bougainvillia)) 
```


```{r}
NMDS_trim <- metaMDS(zoopl_trim, autotransform = TRUE,
                        maxit = 100, trymax = 50)
```

```{r}
plot(NMDS_trim, type = 't')
```

# Cluster Analysis 
```{r cluster_analysis}
d <- vegdist(zoopl_trim, "bray") # Bray-Curtis default 
clust <- hclust(d, method = 'average')          # This is agglomerative clustering - build the groups
                            # from a single observation not split them apart...
cut7 <- cutree(clust, 7)    # this cut number is arbitrary
```

```{r fig.width = 8}
plot(clust, hang = -1)
```

```{r}
plot_data <- data.frame(NMDS_trim$points) %>%
    mutate(id = zoopl_community$new_id)
```

## Plot Clusters
```{r plot_clusters}
plot_data <- plot_data %>%
  mutate(cluster = factor(cut7),
         row = row_number())

plt <- ggplot(data = plot_data, aes(MDS1, MDS2)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = cluster), size = 2.5) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = 'C', name = 'Cluster') +
  coord_fixed()
plt
```
```{r}
plot(NMDS_trim, type = 't')
hull <- ordihull(NMDS_trim, groups = cut7, display = "sites")
```

The ordination largely pulls out a couple of high Balanus 
samples.  Everything else is a bit of a jumble.  The problem here is that 
Balanus has some very high variability -- not found in every sample -- so this
may not be all that informative.


# Finer Control of Graphics
To get greater control over these plots, we need to move all this to 
`ggplot()`.

## Understanding `ordihull()`
`vegan` is built largely on S3 classes.  Here, the underlying implementation
is based on a named list, , so it's easy to find a starting point by looking at 
the names in the object returned by `ordihull()`.
```{r what_is_ordihull}
class(hull)
names(hull)
```

I doubt it is a coincidence that the list has eight objects and we defined eight
clusters. We look at the first item in this list.

```{r check_first_ordihull_item}
class(hull[[1]])
hull[[1]]
```

It's just an array containing the points of the vertexes of the polygons. Each 
polygon is passed as an array of points. We can work with that, although
it is going to be easier to "flatten" the data structure.

We need to convert each array to a data frame (tibble) and append them,
retaining their cluster identities. This can be done in several ways. Here I
convert the arrays to tibbles, then bind them into one tibble with
`bind_rows()`, which conveniently allows you to label each entry with the source
data frame (here the cluster number).

```{r build_hulls_df}
hullsdfs <- map(hull, as_tibble) # Creates a list of tibbles
hulls_df <- hullsdfs %>%
  bind_rows(.id = 'Cluster')  # converts number in the list to a variable
hulls_df
```

## Plot Clusters and  Convex Hulls
```{r plot_clusters_small, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
plt <- ggplot(data = plot_data, aes(MDS1, MDS2)) + 
  #geom_point(aes(color = cluster), size = 1.25) +
  geom_text(aes(label = row, color = cluster), size = 4) +
  geom_polygon(data=hulls_df,  
               mapping = aes(x= NMDS1,y= NMDS2, group = Cluster,
                             color = Cluster),
               #color = 'black',
               fill = NA) + 
 # scale_color_viridis_d(option = 'B', name = 'Cluster') +
  
  # Adjust size of legend
  theme(legend.key.size = unit(0.35, 'cm')) +
  
  # Set aspect ratio (defaults to 1)
  coord_fixed() 
plt
```

What jumps out is that most observations fall into a central cluster.  A few of
the other, smaller clusters consist of a couple of sequential observations,
suggesing several of the clusters are sequentially close 
observations, which suggests a strong pattern to these data, if only we can 
figure out what it is....

```{r plot_clusters_large, fig.width = 5}
plt <- ggplot(data = plot_data, aes(MDS1, MDS2)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = cluster), size = 2) +
  geom_polygon(data=hulls_df,  
               mapping = aes(x= NMDS1,y= NMDS2, group = Cluster),
               color = 'black', fill = NA) + 
  #scale_color_viridis_d(option = 'C', name = 'Cluster') +
  
  # Adjust size of legend
  theme(legend.key.size = unit(0.35, 'cm')) +
  
  # Set aspect ratio (defaults to 1)
  coord_fixed() 
plt
```

Cluster 3 does not align all that well with the ordination.  Note that several
clusters consist of only a single sample.  Overall, the cluster analysis here is
not proving all that helpful.
