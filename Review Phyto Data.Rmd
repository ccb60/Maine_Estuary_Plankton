#Introduction
In this notebook, I am reviewing data in one of the two data files I was 
provided.  Principally, this is to get familiar with the contents of the file, 
but it is also to check the relationship among tabs and conduct initial data
QA/QC.

#Load Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

library(GGally)

library(emmeans)

theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

# Data Tabs in the Excel File
The data in the excel file is divided among many tabs, not all laid out the same 
way.
```{r}
fn <- 'SEANET_Phyto Data_Bigelow.xlsx'

(tabs <- excel_sheets(fn))
```
# Load Flowcam Data
## FCM Data
```{r}
flowcam_data_FCM <- read_excel(fn, sheet = "FCAM FCM", skip = 59) %>%
  rename_with(.fn = ~sub(" \\(.*", "", .x) ) %>%
 #rename_with(.fn = ~sub("FCM ", "", .x) ) %>%
  rename_with(.fn = ~sub("Vol", "", .x) ) %>%
  rename_with(.fn = ~sub(" *$", "", .x) ) %>%
  rename_with(.fn = ~gsub(" ", "_", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(.fn = ~gsub("\\.", "", .x)) %>%
  rename('Total_GT_20' = starts_with('Total_>'))
```

### Data Groups
Notice that not all groups are equivalent, so these should not be analyzed as
one large group.

```{r}
cat ('\n**************Basic Phytoplankton Volumes******************\n')
names(flowcam_data_FCM)[2:30]
cat ('\n**************Non Phytoplankton ******************\n')
names(flowcam_data_FCM)[31:34]
cat ('\n**************Group Total Volumes******************\n')
names(flowcam_data_FCM)[35:38]
cat ('\n**************Group Total Biomass******************\n')
names(flowcam_data_FCM)[39:43]
```

Biomass is a simple function of volumes, so little point in analyzing both.

```{r}
ggplot(flowcam_data_FCM, aes(Total_Diatom_FCM, Total_Diatom_FCM_Biomass)) +
  geom_point()
```


```{r}
ggpairs(log(flowcam_data_FCM[35:38]), progress = FALSE)
```

Why are some not showing correlation coefficients? The problem crops us for
any correlation involving the ciliates, although there are no missing values or
other problems. Note that diatom vs ciliates may show a non-linear pattern.

A simple Pearson correlation won't give results, but Spearman and Kendall do.

```{r}
cor(log(flowcam_data_FCM[35:38]), method = 'spearman', use = 'pairwise')
```

## ABD Data
This is apparently based on a slightly different method for estimating 
biovolume. These SHOULD be highly correlated with the last set of values.

```{r}
library(readxl)
flowcam_data_ABD <- read_excel("SEANET_Phyto Data_Bigelow.xlsx", 
                               sheet = "FCAM ABD", skip = 58) %>%
  rename_with(.fn = ~sub(" \\(.*", "", .x) ) %>%
  #rename_with(.fn = ~sub("ABD", "", .x) ) %>%
  rename_with(.fn = ~sub("Vol", "", .x) ) %>%
  rename_with(.fn = ~sub(" *$", "", .x) ) %>%
  rename_with(.fn = ~gsub(" ", "_", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(.fn = ~gsub("\\.", "", .x)) %>%
  rename('Total_GT_20' = starts_with('Total_>'))
```

## Compare Flowcam Data sets
### Compare Variable Names
They all match.
```{r}
cbind(names(flowcam_data_FCM), names(flowcam_data_ABD))
```

### Compare Sample IDs
We note two samples in the ABD tab that lack sample IDs, although all other
sample IDs match.

```{r}
test <- cbind(flowcam_data_FCM$Sample_ID, flowcam_data_ABD$Sample_ID)
which(test[,1] != test[,2])
which(test[,1] != test[,2])
which(is.na(test[,1]))
which(is.na(test[,2]))
```

I suspect data corruption somewhere, so for now, I'll 
substitute the Sample ID from the other tab.
```{r}
flowcam_data_ABD$Sample_ID[25] <- flowcam_data_FCM$Sample_ID[25]
flowcam_data_ABD$Sample_ID[26] <- flowcam_data_FCM$Sample_ID[26]
```

### Compare Total Algae Biomass
```{r}
flowcam_data_ABD %>%
  select(Sample_ID, Total_GT_20 ) %>%
  rename(tot = Total_GT_20) %>%
  full_join(flowcam_data_FCM) %>%
  select(Sample_ID, Total_GT_20, tot) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Total_GT_20, tot)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  xlab('log Total GT 20 from ABD') +
  ylab('log Total GT 20 from FCM')
```

So, the two metrics provide correlated estimates of total biomass GT 20, with
FCM usually estimating slightly larger totals. I suspect we can treat these two
tabs as nearly equivalent.  I will leave it up to Kevin to decide which to use.
For now, I will work with the FCM tab only.

# Load Collection Data
```{r}
collection_data <- read_excel("SEANET_Phyto Data_Bigelow.xlsx", 
    sheet = "COLLECTION", col_types = c("date", 
        "date", "text", "numeric", "numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "date", "text", 
        "numeric", "numeric", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "numeric", 
        "numeric", "numeric", "numeric"), 
    skip = 20, na = '-999') %>%
  rename_with(.fn = ~sub(" \\(.*", "", .x) ) %>%
  rename_with(.fn = ~gsub(" ", "_", .x))
```

That does not properly import the time of sample collection, but that's not
worth fixing for now.

Secchi Depth data has a couple of records on bottom, and a couple that look
like they were wrongly measured in feet? Anyway, the values ( over 25) are 
unlikely in the extreme.






The last four columns here are apparently copied from the PICO-NANO tab. However,
it looks like the copied data did not correctly account for the inconsistent
labeling on that tab.  I do not trust alignment with the sample IDs.  I would
rather regenerate the match myself later.

# Data on Picoplankton and Nanoplankton
```{r}
pico_data <- read_excel("SEANET_Phyto Data_Bigelow.xlsx", 
                        sheet = "PICO-NANO")  %>%
  rename_with(.fn = ~sub(" \\(.*", "", .x) ) %>%
  rename_with(.fn = ~gsub(" ", "_", .x))
```

We note that we have one MORE sample here than indicated in the data on sample
collection.  This is because one sample ID is not represented and two sample IDs 
are duplicated.

```{r}
 collection_data$Sample_ID[ ! collection_data$Sample_ID %in% pico_data$Sample_ID ]
```

```{r}
pico_data$Sample_ID[duplicated( pico_data$Sample_ID)]
```

It's possible the first is a mis-labeling, since a duplicate is adjacent to
the missing value. The second, however, can not be explained away so  readily. 

Let's check sample alignment.  it suggests the two Tabs are inconsistent.  I
need to know which is correct before I can continue.

```{r}
collection_data %>%
  select(Sample_ID, Total_Phyto_Conc) %>%
  rename(Total = Total_Phyto_Conc) %>%
  full_join(pico_data, by = "Sample_ID") %>%
  select(Sample_ID, Total, Total_Phyto_Conc)
```

# Data on Chlorophyll and Phaeophytin
We drop the "pre calculated" means and standard deviations for the time being.
they are simple to recalculate in R, and that way I have full documentation of 
methods and assumptions.

```{r}
chl_data <-   read_excel("SEANET_Phyto Data_Bigelow.xlsx", 
                        sheet = "CHL", skip = 25) %>%
  select(-starts_with('Avg')) %>%
  rename_with(.fn = ~sub(" \\(.*", "", .x) ) %>%
  rename_with(.fn = ~gsub(" ", "_", .x)) %>%
  mutate(Replicate = substr(Sample_ID, nchar(Sample_ID), nchar(Sample_ID)),
         Sample_ID = substr(Sample_ID, 1, nchar(Sample_ID)-2)) %>%
  relocate(Replicate, .after = 'Sample_ID')
```

# Summary data on Chlorophyll and Phaephytin
The rows of data with just the averages appear to have been copied to the next
Tab in the spreadsheet.  This is likely as a convenience for combining with
other environmental variables.

The data import triggers many warnings about coercing numbers to dates, but that
is because for some reason, R is not importing these dates quite correctly.

```{r}
chl_avg_data <- read_excel("SEANET_Phyto Data_Bigelow.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Sheet1", col_types = c("text", 
        "date", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
        "numeric", "numeric", "numeric"))
```

# Maximum Photosynthesis Data
```{r}
pmax_data <- read_excel("SEANET_Phyto Data_Bigelow.xlsx", 
    sheet = "PMAX", skip = 12)

names(pmax_data) <- c('Sample_ID', 'pmax', 'pmax_chl', 'Comments')
```

# Nutrients Data
```{r}
nutrients_data <-  read_excel("SEANET_Phyto Data_Bigelow.xlsx",
                              sheet = "DIN", skip = 5)
names(nutrients_data) <- c('Sample_ID', 'NOx', 'NO2', 'NO3',
                           'NH4', 'PO4', 'Si')
```

## Add Organic Nitrogen Data
```{r}
DON_data <- read_excel("SEANET_Phyto Data_Bigelow.xlsx", 
    sheet = "DON", skip = 5)
names(DON_data) <- c("Sample_ID", "DON")

nutrients_data <- nutrients_data %>%
  full_join(DON_data, by = "Sample_ID") %>%
  relocate(DON, .after = NH4)
```

```{r}
rm(DON_data)
```

# C N Data and Stable Isotope Data
This is found in two different Tabs.  It appears these are some replicate 
analyses here, labeled in confusing ways....

The Elemental N and C values are labeled as "not blank corrected".  I 
am not sure whether they should be blank corrected, and if so, how to do so 
correctly.  My tendency would be to "correct" by the mean value of the blanks. 
This would have a small effect on elemental carbon, but a sizable effect on 
elemental nitrogen.  

But because of these uncertainties, I focus only on the stable isotope values.

```{r}
POC1_data <- read_excel("SEANET_Phyto Data_Bigelow.xlsx", 
                        sheet = "POC1", skip = 11, n_max = 30) %>%
  rename(Sample_ID = `Sample ID`) %>%
  mutate(Replicate = substr(Sample_ID, nchar(Sample_ID), nchar(Sample_ID)),
         Sample_ID = substr(Sample_ID, 1, nchar(Sample_ID)-2)) %>%
  relocate(Replicate, .after = 'Sample_ID') %>%
  select(c(1,2,9,10, 11))
  
names(POC1_data)[3] <- 'Delta_N'
names(POC1_data)[4] <- 'Delta_C'
```

```{r}
POC2_data <- read_excel("SEANET_Phyto Data_Bigelow.xlsx", 
                        sheet = "POC2", skip = 11, n_max = 30) %>%
  rename(Sample_ID = `Sample ID`) %>%
  mutate(Replicate = 'C') %>%
  relocate(Replicate, .after = 'Sample_ID') %>%
  select(c(1,2,10, 11, 12))

POC2_data$Replicate[19] <- 'D'  # Only apparent duplicate in second round of analysis

names(POC2_data)[3] <- 'Delta_N'
names(POC2_data)[4] <- 'Delta_C'
```

```{r}
POC_data <- POC1_data %>%
  bind_rows(POC2_data)
rm(POC1_data, POC2_data)
```

## Review of Delta_N data
```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(POC_data, aes(Sample_ID, Delta_N)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = ! is.na(Comments), shape = Replicate)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.2))
```

So, looking at that, we see  two outliers, both of which were flagged in the
analytic results.  We delete them.

```{r}
POC_data <- POC_data %>%
  mutate(Delta_N = if_else(row_number() %in% c(16,17), NA_real_, Delta_N))
```

# Calculate Average Values
```{r}
POC_data_sum <- POC_data %>%
  group_by(Sample_ID) %>%
  summarize(Delta_N_mean = mean(Delta_N, na.rm = TRUE),
            Delta_N_SD =   sd(Delta_N, na.rm = TRUE),
            Deta_N_n  =    sum(! is.na(Delta_N)),
            Delta_C_mean = mean(Delta_C, na.rm = TRUE),
            Delta_C_SD =   sd(Delta_C, na.rm = TRUE),
            Deta_C_n  =    sum(! is.na(Delta_C)))
```

We have only a single measurement of most samples, yet the standard errors are 
fairly large for those samples where we **do** have replicates. Careful analysis
would estimate standard errors even for those samples with only a single 
analysis based on the error in the samples for which we have multiple laboratory
results.

# Reflection of data contents.
1.  We have collection records for 77 samples.

2.  We also have 77 rows for

    * `chl_avg_data`  
    * `nutrients_data`  
    * `pmax_data`  
    
3.  `pico_data` has 78 rows, because of exactly one replicate (?) sample

4.  We have only 74 rows in the flowcam community data

5.  The two different community analysis methods appear highly correlated.

6.  The POC data is more selective, with only 47 unique sample IDs.
